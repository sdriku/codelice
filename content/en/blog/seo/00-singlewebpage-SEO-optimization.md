Keywords in:
- Title and Description fields
- Subheadings and Content
- Title and Alt and file name for each image on the page
- Have an H1 for each section
- each section or div has an id => this id name will also be my "url" for the section, so make sure it is a keyword
- urls, keep it short 2 kw max, urls has to make sense
- internal linking and links to external must use various anchor texts. If I use the same across my page multiple times, Google will penalize me. Use the name of my other website or products, then use the name of a feature of that product or section of that other website etc
- update websites content weekly or at least twice a month (ignore if getting found via search is not a priority for you) with fresh content, as Google crawlers love this. I can update my events or my Google reviews for example
- focus on building authority and credibility through external linking
- use directories and external listings like Google My Business: add keywords there, this will complement my websites SEO
